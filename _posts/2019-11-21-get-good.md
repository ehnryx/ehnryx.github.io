Two weeks ago, my team managed to get first in the [Pacific Northwest Regional Contest
(PACNW)][pacnw]{:target="_blank"}, so we will be competing at both the [North American Championship
(NAC)][nac]{:target="_blank"} in February 2020 and the [ICPC World Finals][wf]{:target="_blank"} in
June 2020. Although we won PACNW, I don't think we have any resemblance of chance at World Finals,
at least not as we are now. Honestly, I'm quite surprised that we even won PACNW. Since this is my
second and last year competing at World Finals, I should probably try to get good. But how does one
get good?

1. decide to get good
2. try to get good
3. ???
4. got good

I think preparing for programming competitions is actually harder than the competitions themselves.
The goal that is "get good" doesn't really help because it's just too vague, and I can't understand
it. Saying "get good" is the same as saying "silver medal at NAC", "top X at World Finals", or "2628
on [Codeforces][cf]{:target="_blank"}". These don't work because I need to get good first (which I
don't know how to do).

I eventually decided to start with something that I am almost doing already: solve at least one
_hard_ problem every day. Here, I arbitrarily define "hard" to mean comparable in difficulty to
(Russian) problems from [opencup.ru][opencup]{:target="_blank"} or [NEERC][neerc]{:target="_blank"}.
I'm not sure how effective this will be (I've already skipped 3 days to start this blog), but at
least I understand this goal better than "get good".
