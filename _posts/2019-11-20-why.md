Hello! My name is Henry, and welcome to my first blog post! Why am I starting a blog? I am not doing
this to

- learn English (UBC is making me take English 110, so pleas pard'n mine erors)
- learn CSS/HTML (\.\.\. I have other interests)
- learn Russian (I vaguely want to learn Russian, but not here)
- ~~get a job~~ please hire me

It seems that the amount of nonsense I want to spout increases with the number of problems I think
about. Recently, I have been thinking about a lot of problems in preparation for [ICPC World Finals
2020][wf]{:target="_blank"} in Moscow (which is the reason why I almost want to learn Russian).
Instead of spamming all of my group chats and getting blocked by everyone, I decided that I might as
well start a blog to pipe all my nonsense into `/dev/null` (and hopefully keep me motivated for the
next 200 days). Anyways, thanks for visiting my site!
