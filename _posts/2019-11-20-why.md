Hello! My name is Henry, and welcome to my first blog post! Why am I starting a blog? I am not doing
this to

- learn English (I will be taking English 110, so pleas pard'on mine erors)
- learn CSS/HTML (\.\.\. I have other interests)
- learn Russian (I vaguely want to learn Russian, but not here)

It seems that the amount of nonsense I want to spout increases with the number of problems I think
about. Recently, I am thinking about a lot of problems in preparation for [ICPC World Finals
2020](https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/rules) in Moscow (which is the reason I almost want to
learn Russian). Instead of spamming all of my group chats and getting blocked by everyone, I decided
that I might as well start a blog and pipe all my nonsense into `/dev/null` (and hopefully keep me
motivated for the next 200 days). Anyways, thanks for visiting my site!
