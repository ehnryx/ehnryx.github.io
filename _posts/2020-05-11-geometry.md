Not a star in sight, I stood bemused\
Under a lightless sky obscured by fog.\
My heart was restless and my mind confused --\
Lost and wandering this ominous bog.

With nary a landmark to be seen, I sought\
The meaning of this strange and alien land.\
Unconsciously I meandered, lost in thought\
As I drifted onto a sandy strand.

When suddenly the wind began to howl\
And through the clouds I gazed upon the sky\
Where countless stars are curiously aligned!\
Dare I claim the answer to be found?
