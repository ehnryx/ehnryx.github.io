Not a star in sight, I stood bemused <br/>
Under a lightless sky obscured by fog. <br/>
My heart was restless and my mind confused -- <br/>
Lost and wandering this ominous bog.

With nary a landmark to be seen, I sought <br/>
The meaning of this strange and alien land. <br/>
Unconsciously I meandered, lost in thought <br/>
As I drifted onto a sandy strand.

When suddenly the wind began to howl <br/>
And through the clouds I gazed upon the sky <br/>
Where countless stars were curiously aligned! <br/>
Dare I claim the answer to be found?
