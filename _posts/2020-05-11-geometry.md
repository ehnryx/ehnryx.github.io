Not a star in sight, I stood bemused <br/>
Beneath a lightless sky obscured by fog. <br/>
My heart was restless and my mind confused --- <br/>
Lost and wandering this ominous bog.

With nary a landmark to be seen, I sought <br/>
The meaning of this strange and forlorn land. <br/>
Unconsciously I meandered, lost in thought, <br/>
Till I chanced upon a sandy strand.

When suddenly the wind begins to howl <br/>
And through the clouds I gaze upon the sky <br/>
Where countless stars are curiously aligned! <br/>
Dare I claim the answer to be found?
